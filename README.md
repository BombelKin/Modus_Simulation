## Preface

**What is the Point of This... Thing?**

Well, to be frank it's mainly just for fun, but it could theorhetically be used for Homestuck based D&D and/or other roleplaying games.

**What are Fetch Modi?**

In Homestuck, fetch modi are the functions that people use to log and "fetch" items from their inventory(called a captchalogue/captcha deck), as well as dictating how items are sorted in the deck. The deck is located in a players sylladex(comparable to (C:)) along with a folder called the Strife Folder.

**What is the Strife Folder?**

It's a folder(duh) that contains different weapon specibi. Weapon specibi are decks that can only hold their "type" of weapon. It's whole purpose is to make accesing weapons easier.
